# SwastikaFinder

**SwastikaFinder** is a highly efficient multi-threaded tool designed for fast searching of swastikas in 3D voxel-based worlds. This tool was developed to identify and eliminate offensive symbols from virtual environments, contributing to safer and more inclusive spaces.  

## Features
- **Fast Searching:** SwastikaFinder can scan up to 16.7 million blocks in just 400 to 600 milliseconds, making it ideal for large-scale voxel environments.
- **Multi-Threaded:** The tool leverages multi-threading to accelerate searches, ensuring minimal performance impact during real-time or bulk operations.

## Description
SwastikaFinder is built for efficiency and accuracy when scanning voxel-based environments for swastikas. By employing multi-threaded algorithms, the tool can quickly traverse massive amounts of data, identifying patterns that match swastika structures. It operates on the premise that symbols may vary in size and thickness but must exist within a single plane in the voxel world.

## Use Cases
- **Server Moderation:** Integrate SwastikaFinder into server moderation tools to automatically detect and remove offensive symbols from public or private voxel worlds.
- **Game Development:** Use SwastikaFinder as part of a content moderation pipeline in voxel-based games to ensure that environments remain safe for players.
- **Community Management:** Administrators of virtual spaces can use SwastikaFinder to uphold community standards by identifying and eliminating harmful content.
- **Batch Processing:** For large-scale cleanup tasks, SwastikaFinder can rapidly analyze entire voxel landscapes, identifying problematic areas for further action.

## How It Works
SwastikaFinder uses highly optimized algorithms to detect swastikas by analyzing the voxel grid. The algorithms consider multiple orientations and can handle symbols of any sizes and shape, ensuring robust and reliable detection. With multi-threading, it can process **16.7 million blocks in just 400-600 milliseconds**, allowing for rapid detection even in vast environments.

## Good Intent
**Disclaimer:** This tool was created with the best of intentions to remove harmful and offensive symbols from virtual environments. It is not designed to promote censorship but to help maintain positive, inclusive spaces for all users. By detecting and eliminating swastikas, we hope to foster healthier online communities where everyone feels safe.
